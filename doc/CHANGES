Changes in ATK 6.5
------------------
* Improved behaviour of atkDummyAttribute when setting flags in the 
  meta node. [Peter]
+ Added special 'atknested' request parameter which causes ATK to instantly
  redirect to the given URL with session mode SESSION_NESTED. This can be
  used to prepend something on the stack. For example, a direct add link in
  the menu which prepends the admin action so that after the user is done
  adding the record, the user is redirected to the admin screen instead of
  getting a new empty form. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkMySQLiDb driver which caused problems with special table
  names that need to be escaped when retrieving metadata. [Peter]
  when retrieving table metadata. [Peter]
* Themes now support the new PHP style templates too. [Peter]
* Improved tooltip support (reminder, if you add a <node>_<column>_tooltip
  entry in your text file it will be displayed as a help text when hovering
  a special help icon). [Peter]
* small optimization to AtkStringParser->getFields(). [Matthijs]
* removed class AtkOneToManyRelationSessionGridHandler from file 
  class.atkonetomanyrelation.inc and put it into its own file. 
  Otherwise the classloader couldn't properly cache this class and 
  would rebuild the class list every time. [Matthijs]
* Fixed retrieval of last insert id for the MySQLi db driver. 
  In certain situations where a table with an autoincrement column is used, the
  driver would return 0 instead of the newly incremented id. [Matthijs]
+ Added atkAddHandler::setSaveAction, atkSaveHandler::setAddAction, 
  atkEditHandler::setUpdateAction and atkUpdatehandler::setEditAction to
  make it more easy to use these handlers inside custom actions. [Peter]
* Fixed extended search. Search was broken for nodes with numberattribute
  the attribute always called the getsearchcondition which resulted
  in including a search for 0 values. Also fixed a typo that caused
  a fatal error. [Martin, Peter]
+ [EXPERIMENTAL] Added atkAttribute::observeJS($event, $body) method which 
  can be used to observe JavaScript events on attribute fields. [Peter]  
* Updated PrototypeJS to version 1.6.1. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed AF_DATE_STRING support in the dateattribute. Reported by
  Arjen Tebbenhof. Thanks Arjen for providing a patch and reporting this
  issue! [Arjen Tebbenhof, Martin]
+ Added data retrieval convenience methods to atkDb (getRow, getRowsAssoc,
  getValuesAssoc) which support specifying columns to use for the key
  (or value) in the result set. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Improved getValue and getValues methods in atkDb, now support
  both numerical and string column names. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Fixed bug in atkDb::getValue which might have caused the retrieval of
  more rows than necessary. Please note: if you use a custom limit
  expression in your getValue query you might run into trouble because
  of this change, please specify false for the $useLimit parameter or
  remove your custom limit. [Peter, Tjeerd]
