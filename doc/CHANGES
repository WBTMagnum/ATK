Changes in ATK 6.4
------------------
+ Added methods for removing filters to atkDataGrid, e.g.
  atkDataGrid::removeFilter and atkDataGrid::removeFilters. [Peter]
+ Added an option to atkNode::countDb, atkNode::selectDb and atkSelector
  to ignore the default filters that have been set on a node. [Peter]
* atkDataGrid now makes sure that it doesn't set filters twice, when
  retrieving data for the grid, by using the new ignoreDefaultFilters() 
  switch in atkSelector. [Peter]   
* atkStringParser now has an option to disable the replacing of unknown
  fields with an empty string. This is used for record action URL's which
  can otherwise not easily contain array-based parameters. [Peter]
* $config_meta_caching is in skel/config.inc.php by default disabled because 
  if you start developing a new application, your tables are  still in flux. 
  Having this option enabled by default causes a lot of confusion. Next to 
  this the performance impact isn't huge, so even if people forget to enable 
  this option it isn't a big deal (but if you are reading this, you should 
  enable this option on production environments!). If the option is disabled 
  the debug output contains a special warning. [Peter]
* PHP 5.3 compatibility fixes. [Peter]
+ Added support for editing records in-line in a datagrid. Note: This feature 
  is still EXPERIMENTAL, at the moment there is no good validation/error 
  handeling yet. To enable this feature simply set some attributes as editable 
  using $node->setEditableListAttributes(...). [Peter]
* Make sure if someone resorts a grid on a certain column the 
  current record offset is reset to 0. [Peter]
* Added AF_BOOL_HIDE_TOOLBAR flag for atkBoolAttribute which can be
  used to hide the select all, none etc. links. [Peter]
* ATK now first searches for nodes in <module>/nodes/ and only 
  falls back to <module>/ if necessary. [Peter]
* Improved the speed of CSV imports (bug #1271) [Arjen]
* atkExportHandler now respects the current search parameters 
  (bug #1251). [Arjen, Peter]
* Fixed func_concat for OCI8 driver (bug #571). [Arjen]
* Lower attribute columns or expressions when sorting (bug #1311)
  [Arjen, Peter]
+ Added support for Microsoft's Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) 
  authentication  (bug #978). [Matthieu, Ivo]
+ Added support for displaying boolean fields as checkboxes in list/view
  mode (bug #682) [MichaelZ, Peter]
* Fixed import of certain CSV import files (bug #796). [Alfred]
+ Added support for specifying columns for attributes which can be used in
  the theme to show attributes in different columns (bug #1017) [Rik, Peter]
+ Added specific template for view actions in Steelblue theme, because IE was
  having some troubles with nested forms in the view action. [Tjeerd]
+ Added OnChangeHandler support for the atkfileattribute. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed sorting m2one relations. Switching between sort orders didn't
  work. Sorting was only possible in asc order. [Martin]
+ Added OnChangeHandler support for the atktimeattribute. [Martin]
+ Add 'showAll' atkDGList option. When true (default), the 'records per 
  page' option will have an 'all' option. [Marc]
* Fixed displaying of 'size' (integral part) of atkNumberAttribute. [Paul 
  Reid, Boy]
* Fixed displaying of large integer (non-decimals) numbers of 
  atkNumberAttribute (larger than 2147483647). [Paul Reid, Boy]
