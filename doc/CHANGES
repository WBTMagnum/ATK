Changes in ATK 6.6
------------------
+ Added atkDGList::_renderRecordActionLink(). This can be overridden to influence the
  way record actions are rendered in a datagrid. [Matthijs]
* Fixed view mode auto-link for read-only fields. [Peter]
+ Added atkViewHandler::getFormButtons() and made the view handler use it, so 
  that it conforms to the way other handlers get their formbuttons. [Matthijs]
* Fixed value2db of atkBoolAttribute. [Sandy]
+ Added box template support to atkPageBuilder. [Peter]
* Fixed column support for meta node. [Peter]
* Changed the handleCancel call in atkUpdateHandler, so that it can be 
  overridden in your node. [mvdvelden]
* Fixed bug in atkNode which causes attributes to be given the wrong index
  when an attribute had been removed in between. [Peter]
+ Added atkDataGrid::setMasterNode(...) which is used by the
  atkOneToManyRelation to set it's owner instance. This isn't used directly
  by the atkDataGrid itself, but can be used by modifiers or listeners. [Peter]
+ Added preAddToViewArray method to atkNode and atkAttribute which works
  similar to the preAddToEditArray methods but is invoked when creating
  the view array for the view handler. [Peter]
+ Added AMQ_WARNING message type to atkMessageQueue. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in atkMySQLiStatement which caused database errors to be
  reported as unknown error instead of the much more useful database error
  message. [Peter]
* atkError now supports printing errors based on a given exception. [Peter]
* Fixing file size check and made some validation changes so that the actual
  error is shown. [mvdvelden]
* Fixed quoting of identifiers in order by clause. It now conforms to the way 
  atkquery quotes fields with multiple identifiers such as schema name and/or
  database name [Matthijs]
* Fixed quoting of identifiers in order by clause. [Peter]
* Fixed reset of atkSessionStore. [Sandy]
* Added a span around the currencysymbol of the currency attribute. [Sandy]
* Stillblue menu now has a fixed position so that it always shown even if
  you scroll down the page. [Peter]
+ Added atkAttribute::setEditCallback and atkAttribute::setViewCallback
  which can be used to register a callback for overriding the edit or
  display functionality of an attribute. [Peter]
* Sort atkNode's attribute list when the order of attributes is changed
  (and attribSort is called). [Peter]
* Add template name in HTML/XML comments when rendering templates on debug
  level 3. Makes it easy to find the origin of template HTML/XML. [Peter]
* Fixed a bug where the hidden field atkescape would contain a wrong value by
  setting the autocomplete attribute of the field to off [Matthijs]
+ Added atkDataGrid::registerModifier to register a grid modifier outside
  the node or relation that uses it. [Peter]
* atkController::loadDispatchPage now also supports array selectors for 
  multi record actions (MRA). [Matthijs] 
* Close atkDateAttribute's calendar on single date click. [Peter]
* atkOneToOneRelation now also respects the attribute's tab for errors if the
  AF_ONETOONE_RESPECT_TABS flag is set. [Peter]
* atkAttribute::preAddToEditArray now also gets the fieldrefix passed. [Peter]
* Fixed bug in MySQLi database driver which caused the length of fields to be a 
  factor 3 of their real size if the characterset was set to UTF-8. [Peter]
* atkFieldSet now marks itself as errornous if one of it's fields contains
  errornous data. [Peter]
* Improved email validation by adding case support in the local part
  of an emailaddress in the atkEmailAttribute::validate(). [Martin]
* Fixed bug in atkDateAttribute that if no date was selected yet the day
  drop-down is empty (instead of containing options 1 to 31). [Peter]
* Added atkform.js for submitting an ATK form using an Ajax 
  request. [Peter, Sandy]
* Added unique cache prefix to atkCacheTestCase in order to prevent collisions
  between simultanious runs of PHPUnit. [Guido]
