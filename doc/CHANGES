Changes in ATK 6.5
------------------
* Fixed extended search. Search was broken for nodes with numberattribute
  the attribute always called the getsearchcondition which resulted
  in including a search for 0 values. Also fixed a typo that caused
  a fatal error. [Martin]
+ [EXPERIMENTAL] Added atkAttribute::observeJS($event, $body) method which 
  can be used to observe JavaScript events on attribute fields. [Peter]  
* Updated PrototypeJS to version 1.6.1. [Tjeerd]
* Fixed AF_DATE_STRING support in the dateattribute. Reported by
  Arjen Tebbenhof. Thanks Arjen for providing a patch and reporting this
  issue! [Arjen Tebbenhof, Martin]
+ Added data retrieval convenience methods to atkDb (getRow, getRowsAssoc,
  getValuesAssoc) which support specifying columns to use for the key
  (or value) in the result set. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Improved getValue and getValues methods in atkDb, now support
  both numerical and string column names. [Peter, Tjeerd]
* Fixed bug in atkDb::getValue which might have caused the retrieval of
  more rows than necessary. Please note: if you use a custom limit
  expression in your getValue query you might run into trouble because
  of this change, please specify false for the $useLimit parameter or
  remove your custom limit. [Peter, Tjeerd]
