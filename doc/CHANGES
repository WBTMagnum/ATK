Changes in ATK 6.3
------------------
* In atkQuery, the join condition in addJoin is moved from the where clause 
  to the join clause where it belongs. [Patrick]
* Fixed forgetCriteria() and saveCriteria() from abstractsearchhandler, 
  when we use transact sql db. [Yury]
* Attribute values from the request will be used by initial_values. [Peter]
+ Added atkOneToManyRelation::setUseRefKeyForFilter which can be used
  to disable the usage of the ref key as filter for the grid. This allows
  you to use a atkOneToManyRelations inside a node which has no direct
  link with the parent node (mainly for displaying stuff). [Peter]
* Fixed brackets in the count query, they are now the same as the select
  query uses. [Sandy]
* atkZip::extract no longer throws warnings when $entries is omitted when
  using 'internal' mode. This is a PHP bug work around. [mvdvelden]
* The atkNode::editArray may now return an "extra" column for fields with
  arbitrary data that needs to be passed to the edit template. [Peter]
* Empty list option can now be configured on a per node field basis. [Peter]
* Fixed searching in fields with autocompletion in  m2o relations. [Martin] 
+ Added atkManyToManyListRelation::setAutoCalculateRows which makes it
  possible to turn off the default behavior of calculating the displayed
  number of rows in the list based on the available selection size. [Peter]
* Show option title in tooltip for atkExtendableShuttleRelation. [Peter]
+ Implemented display functionality for atkRadioDetailsAttribute. [Peter]
* atkManytoManySelectRelation now doesn't load the complete record anymore
  when displaying the current value. [Peter]
* Generated code for a meta node is now only displayed when debug level
  is set to 3 (and caching is turned off). [Peter]
+ atkConsoleController can now be started with --list to get a list of
  controller actions or with --debug followed by the action name to
  output log information directly on the command line. [Peter]
+ atkConsoleController now accepts the path name to a console controller
  as valid controller class (useful when using auto-completion on the
  command line). [Peter]
* Improved atkConsoleController log file output, and now logging to
  a single file per controller per day (no distinction between types). [Peter]
+ Added 'save criteria' functionality to the atkSearchHandler. This 
  functionality only works when the table atk_searchcriteria is present in 
  your database. Note: When you are using the atkSmartSearchHandler, please 
  rename your atk_smartsearchcriteria table to atk_searchcriteria and 
  add `handlertype` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL to your new table and fill this 
  new field with the value 'atksmartsearchhandler'.[Martijn]
+ Added configuration option 'mail_redirect' to defaultconfig.inc.php. See
  defaultconfig.inc.php for more details. [patrick]
+ Added setter and getter for sessionStatus in atkDialog. [Arjen]
+ Added concat function in atkDb. [Sandy]
+ Added method for setting the destination node of Auto links in the
  atkManyToOneRelation. [Sandy]
+ Added setGridExcludes and getGridExcludes functions to atkonetomanyrelation.
  Using these functions it is possible to set the fields that should be 
  excluded in the datagrid of the relation even if these fields don't have the
  AF_HIDE_LIST flag. The refkeys are excluded by default. Using the 
  setGridExcludes function will overrule the default. [Lineke]
* Fixed searching in atkManyToOneRelation in extended mode. [Martijn]
* Warn user for calls to atkNode::primaryKeyField if there is no primary key
  defined. [Max, Peter]
* Set session status for (onetomany) add (-or-copy) dialog to session_partial.
  [Arjen]
* Disabled multi-record-actions in select handler. [Peter]
* Fixed strange bug with sessions where atkSecurityManager would set
  a session with a different cookiepath and repeatedly logging in
  and logging out would cause the user to lose the ability to
  log in at all. [Boy, Harrie]
* Fixed setting the supported languages by using the config
  supported_languages. [Arjen, Dennis]
* Removed Czechoslovakia (CS) from the country definition list in
  atkCountryAttribute. [mvdvelden]
* Implemented fallback for atkConfig::get to skel/configs/.
  If a section corresponds to a module, configs from module/skel/configs
  will be used as fallbacks. [Boy, Tjeerd]
* ProfileAttribute: don't use text() function of attribute, because of auto
  module detection (e.g. actions won't translate) [Jeroen]
* Fixed atkAggregatedColumn attribute and added extra searchcondition
  when searchmode is substring. [Sandy]
* atkManyToOne relation now also searches with concat of the descriptor
  template. [Sandy]
* Changed atkMultiselectHandler to use the atkdatagrid in stead of the
  atkrecordlist functionality. [Lineke]
* atkCountryAttribute now also takes charset into account for dutch 
  translations. [Lineke]
* Target url for the select link of an atkManyToOnerelation is now encoded
  so it also works for proxy servers the decode the url. [Sandy] 
* Added dropdown menu to the supported menu classes in the atkmenuclass. 
  [Lineke]
* atkManyToOneRelation now uses the getOrderByStatement function of the
  columnconfig class to determine the order by clause in the selectDb 
  functions. [Lineke]
