Changes in ATK 6.3
------------------
+ Added 'save criteria' functionality to the atkSearchHandler. This 
  functionality only works when the table atk_searchcriteria is present in 
  your database. Note: When you are using the atkSmartSearchHandler, please 
  rename your atk_smartsearchcriteria table to atk_searchcriteria and 
  add `handlertype` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL to your new table and fill this 
  new field with the value 'atksmartsearchhandler'.[Martijn]
+ Added configuration option 'mail_redirect' to defaultconfig.inc.php. See
  defaultconfig.inc.php for more details. [patrick]
+ Added setter and getter for sessionStatus in atkDialog. [Arjen]
+ Added concat function in atkDb. [Sandy]
* Fixed searching in atkManyToOneRelation in extended mode. [Martijn]
* Warn user for calls to atkNode::primaryKeyField if there is no primary key
  defined or the primary key consists of more than one field. [Max, Peter]
* Set session status for (onetomany) add (-or-copy) dialog to session_partial.
  [Arjen]
* Disabled multi-record-actions in select handler. [Peter]
* Fixed strange bug with sessions where atkSecurityManager would set
  a session with a different cookiepath and repeatedly logging in
  and logging out would cause the user to lose the ability to
  log in at all. [Boy, Harrie]
* Fixed setting the supported languages by using the config
  supported_languages. [Arjen, Dennis]
* Removed Czechoslovakia (CS) from the country definition list in
  atkCountryAttribute. [mvdvelden]
* Implemented fallback for atkConfig::get to skel/configs/.
  If a section corresponds to a module, configs from module/skel/configs
  will be used as fallbacks. [Boy, Tjeerd]
* ProfileAttribute: don't use text() function of attribute, because of auto
  module detection (e.g. actions won't translate) [Jeroen]
* Fixed atkAggregatedColumn attribute and added extra searchcondition
  when searchmode is substring. [Sandy]
* atkManyToOne relation now also searches with concat of the descriptor
  template. [Sandy]
* Changed atkMultiselectHandler to use the atkdatagrid in stead of the
  atkrecordlist functionality. [Lineke]
* atkCountryAttribute now also takes charset into account for dutch 
  translations. [Lineke]
