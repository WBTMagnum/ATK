  mode (bug #682) [MichaelZ, Peter]

+ Added support for specifying columns for attributes which can be used in
  the theme to show attributes in different columns (bug #1017) [Rik, Peter]
+ Added specific template for view actions in Steelblue theme, because IE was
  having some troubles with nested forms in the view action. [Tjeerd]

  work. Sorting was only possible in asc order. [Martin]

  option will have an 'all' option.
  This is the default behaviour. [Marc]
